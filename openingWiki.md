# Opening wiki
---

Now anyone can edit the wiki (except for specific pages, such as the index). The wiki originally was used a medium of keeping track of useful resources, such as websites, youtube channels and etc. However since only selected members could edit it, it did not grow much. Note that If you decide to misuse this privilege, we (mods) will ban you (most likely without a warning) from editing the wiki. You can create your own pages, but I would prefer if you ask me before creating new pages. I think if you guys would want we could task certain people to deal with maintaining links for a subject or with generating pages for a subject, please let me know what you think about this.

# GDrive for sharing user created resources
---

The idea here is to create a Google Drive to have all the resources such as notes/IAs/other coursework which was created by reddit users, as often when someone posts them, the resources would have disappeared or be forgotten/difficult to find for new members. Do not post textbooks or past papers here, if you want to share them make your own post and share them with /u/templarknight98.

You can upload files [here](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwBB90XpWughsL9ApqkyJqctJ-CHCj5yofUQB2UXAhK9taOo40/exec). (Note that if you want to upload multiple please upload it as a .zip file). You can view all the files which have been uploaded here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Wpv27KkokY5wYh7PxIL2FsOBMVVBDKG4. This is set up this way, to ensure that not everyone can delete other submitted work, if for whatever reason you do want to delete something please PM me with a reason. 

To have it organised input a name/reddit username if you want to get credit for your work, otherwise you can simply enter anonymous. Note that the files will not manually be edited by me, therefore please remove your name/personal details if you desire to. Please do NOT upload your coursework if you submitted it to the IB and have not received your IB diploma. I will organize the resources according to the following types: IA, TOK Essays, Written Assignment, Notes and others for each subject (similar to the past paper organized according to subject). Also please submit PDF files rather than word or tex files, unless the resource is specifically a template or you have another valid reason. To make my job easier, please name your file using the following standard:

1.  Subject please use this list for the subject you are taking (https://pastebin.com/7ua7d2kA, tell me if there is a subject missing)
1.  Subject Level (Note for TOK this should be ignored/skipped)
1.  Type of resources from the following list: IA (Internal Assessment), EE (Extended Essay), WA (Written Assignment), FOA (Further Oral Activity), IOP (Interactive Oral Presentation), IOC (Individual Oral Commentary), ES (for TOK Essays) and PS (for TOK Presentations); please let me know If there is another type you would like to add to the list.
1.  Examination Session Material was created for in the following format Month (M/N) Year (YY), for example N17
